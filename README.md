# HandVerify: Gesture-Based Number Verification

## Description

**HandVerify** is an innovative application that combines computer vision with hand gesture recognition. The application displays a random number on the screen via the webcam feed, and the user needs to show that number using their hand. The system then verifies if the displayed hand gesture matches the number and confirms it with a "Verified" status.

## Features

- **Random Number Display**: The application generates and displays a random number on the webcam feed.
- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Detects and interprets hand gestures shown in front of the camera.
- **Real-Time Verification**: Instantly verifies if the hand gesture corresponds to the displayed number.
- **User Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback by displaying "Verified" if the gesture matches the number.
